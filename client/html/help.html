				<h1>Help Page</h1> 
				<br><br>

				<p>Hello and welcom to the Eng Soc Forum Help page, here are awnsers to many many commonly asked qustions, as well direct you to resources that will help you if you cannnot find an awsner here.</p>

				<p>To begin what is the Eng Forum? – Well the Eng Forum is a website that is dedicated to Queen’s engineering students. It serves the purpose of a local knowledge bank for engineering students. Here students, given they sign in with their student ID will have access to a hopefully one day vast bank of knowledge.</p>

				<p>These resources are available through a finely tuned search algorithm that allows students to search for any pieces of information, from any subject at any level. The search function is the sites greatest strength, it is the first thing that greats you once you visit the website. All the information however does not come from nowhere. The knowledge and information comes from students asking questions related to school, and other students answering the question if they know it. (more on this later).</p> 

				<p>Users/ students will post questions related to a topic/ class, and other students will answer the question to the best of their ability. Answers that are “quality” will be “upvoted” by other students. This will indicate the quality of the answer to other students, as well as make the answer more visible.</p> 

				<p>These are the basics to the website, more details on the website can be seen below.</p>
