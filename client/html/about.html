            <p>The Engineering Forum was a project that the EngSoc IT Team began during the 2016-2017 school year with the objective of making it easier for students to ask each other questions and to help other students have access to that information. The forum was designed to be a space where homework and other school-related questions could be asked. Additionally, the forum was to be a place where other school-related information could be gathered, curated and shared as a powerful resource at the disposal of Queen's Engineering Students.</p>
